  import { useFadeIn, useSlideUp } from '@hua-labs/motion-core';

  function Hero() {
    const fadeIn = useFadeIn({ duration: 800 });
    const slideUp = useSlideUp({ delay: 200 });

    return (
      <div>
        <h1 ref={fadeIn.ref} style={fadeIn.style}>Welcome</h1>
        <p ref={slideUp.ref} style={slideUp.style}>Animated content</p>
      </div>
