/**
 * @hua-labs/state - SSR Middleware
 * 
 * SSR support for Zustand stores to prevent hydration mismatches
 * 
 * Note: Zustand's persist middleware already handles SSR well by default.
 * This module is kept for future SSR optimizations if needed.

// SSR support is handled automatically by Zustand's persist middleware
// when used with Next.js App Router. No additional middleware needed.
